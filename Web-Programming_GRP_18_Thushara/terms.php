        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <h2>Common Terms & Conditions for Clothing Company Purchases</h2>
        <h3>Return Policy</h3>
        <p>Defining a return policy will help to quell customer disputes regarding past purchases. Retailers commonly use a 15 to 60 day return policy on clothing. Customers receive their return either the same way they paid (in cash or back on the card they used) or in store credit. Customers who make returns without a receipt are typically given store credit for the lowest sale value of the item being returned.</p>

        <h3>Limiting Quantities</h3>
        <p>Most terms and conditions outline a policy that bans customers from purchasing their merchandise for the purposes of reselling. The retailer always has exclusive control over the quantities of any items customers are purchasing and at any time may limit how much customers buy or revoke their purchasing rights altogether. This is the easiest way to prevent your merchandise from being resold.</p>
